Find paper on Arxiv :postbox: :bookmark_tabs: in your terminal !

## WARNING: This is a work in progress !

## Problem
Subscribing or scrolling ArXiv or BioArxiv is time-consuming, there must be a
way to automate our need of curiosity. The aim of this project is to build a
simple CLI to query the API of both websites. Let us have a direct access to
new papers, their authors' names and their abstract right from the terminal !
